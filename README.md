Greetings friends!

CommonLily here but in reality I like to think I'm anything anything but common.  I enjoy arcade games and cereal.  Stephen King is my favorite author and someday I'll find a movie of one of his stories that do his writing justice.  I like to pick up heavy things and carry them around - because muscles.
